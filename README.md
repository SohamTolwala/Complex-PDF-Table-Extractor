# Complex-PDF-Table-Extractor

## Use Case
Handling PDFs with complex structures, especially those containing multiple tables, bills, or unstructured data, can be challenging for simple Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) models. Standard RAG approaches often fail when dealing with complex tables or non-textual elements. This repository presents a solution that accurately detects and extracts table data from such PDFs, leveraging advanced multimodal vision models to ensure precise and structured output.

## Approach
  Our method follows these steps:

  ### 1. PDF Parsing:
  
  Parse the PDF to identify individual pages.
  ### 2. Table Detection:
  
  Utilize a transformer-based table detection model to locate tables on each page.
  ### 3. Table Extraction:
  
  Crop the detected tables from the PDF pages.
  Use multimodal vision models (OpenAI Vision, Claude, Google Gemini Vision Pro) to extract structured data from these cropped table images.
  ### 4. Data Structuring:
  
  Convert the extracted table data into a structured JSON format.
  Optionally, concatenate the JSON data into CSV or XLSX files for further analysis.
  
## Future Integrations
This solution can be further enhanced by integrating it directly into a Multimodal RAG pipeline, allowing for seamless handling of both text and visual data within PDFs. Potential integrations include:

### OpenAI Assistant:

- Directly querying structured data files for insights and analysis.
- Enhancing the accuracy of responses based on complex table data.
- Developing an end-to-end automated workflow that combines table detection, data extraction, and advanced querying into a single pipeline.
